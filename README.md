PRE-PROJECT THOUGHTS:

This is a project to replicate the google homepage.

Things I will need to do:
    -Make the necessary folders (css, images)
    -Grab the images from google itself
    -Figure out how to position the elements as they are on the webpage
        -Center the image and the form
        -How to make a long enough form?
    -Fix the top header
    -Make the footer at the bottom of the page
    
Let's do this!
